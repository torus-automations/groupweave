# Groupweave Context for Gemini

You are working on the **Groupweave** project, a decentralized content curation platform on NEAR Protocol powered by **Private Shade Agents**.

## Project Structure
- **Contracts (`/contracts`)**: Rust smart contracts for NEAR.
  - `voting`: Polls and voting logic.
  - `deposits`: Payment handling.
  - `content-bounty-market`: Main logic for content bounties.
- **Agents (`/agents`)**: **Python-based** autonomous agents running in TEEs.
  - `curation-agent`: Private RAG agent (Phi-3 + Local Docs).
  - `vlm-classifier-agent`: Private Vision agent (Qwen3-VL-2B).

## Preferred Tools & Commands
- **Contracts:** Rust (Cargo).
- **Agents:** Python 3.10+ (Pip).

## Common Tasks

### Working with Agents (Python)
Path: `agents/shade/<agent-name>/`
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/main.py   # Start agent
./scripts/deploy.sh  # Build Docker image
```

### Working with Contracts (Rust)
Path: `contracts/<contract-name>/`
```bash
cargo test
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

## Coding Style
- **Python:** Strong typing (`typing`), Pydantic models, robust error handling (retries).
- **Rust:** Security-first. Use `saturating_` arithmetic. Avoid `unwrap()` in production. Strictly follow Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.

## Architecture Note
Agents are designed to be **private and self-contained**. They run local models (CPU-optimized) to avoid data leakage and minimize Phala Cloud costs.
